# Sign-In Form

A standard log-in form with the fields "username" and "password". This project is dedicated to styling a React application: it does not represent any meaningful functinality development.

## Important note

In this project, I apply different approaches to styling React applications. I decided to organize them to separate branches. For example, the code representing the approach of styling with Styled Components is hosted in the branch "styled-components". Please check all the branches to find different versions of the project. All the versions represent the same storefront display and behavior and differ only with the code.

## Branches
